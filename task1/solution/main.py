def strict(func):
    """
    A decorator for people who like their arguments like they like their types â€” strict.

    Checks that all positional arguments match the function's type annotations.
    If someone tries to sneak in the wrong type, it throws a glorious TypeError
    and makes sure they feel bad about it.

    Only works with:
        - annotated types: bool, int, float, str (nothing fancy, keep it vanilla)

    Args:
        func (Callable): The function to be wrapped in judgment.

    Returns:
        Callable: The wrapped function that now has trust issues.
